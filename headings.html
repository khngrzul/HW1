<h1>Headings</h1>
<p>From the list above, let’s choose “illustration” as our rhetorical purpose. We’ll walk through a 5-step process for building a paragraph that illustrates a point in an argument. For each step there is an explanation and example. Our example paragraph will be about human misconceptions of piranhas.</p>
<h2>Step 1. Decide on a controlling idea and create a topic sentence</h2>
<p>Paragraph development begins with the formulation of the controlling idea. This idea directs the paragraph’s development. Often, the controlling idea of a paragraph will appear in the form of a topic sentence. In some cases, you may need more than one sentence to express a paragraph’s controlling idea. </p>

<h3>Step 2. Elaborate on the controlling idea </h3>
<p>Paragraph development continues with an elaboration on the controlling idea, perhaps with an explanation, implication, or statement about significance. Our example offers a possible explanation for the pervasiveness of the myth. </p>
<h4> Step 3. Give an example (or multiple examples) </h4>
